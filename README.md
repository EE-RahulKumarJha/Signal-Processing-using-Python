# Signal Processing using-Python
<p>
 We first generate a test signal with added noise. We then filter the signal using a 4th order butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.2 Hz, which removes high frequency noise from the signal. We then compute the power spectral density of the filtered signal using the Welch method, which estimates the power spectrum of the signal by averaging periodograms over overlapping segments.
